\section{Large Scale Cooperation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Large Scale Cooperation}

The last half of twentieth century has witnessed a key shift in knowledge intensive production processes.

\begin{block}{The rising importance of collective research and cooperation \citep{uzzi:2007a}}
\begin{itemize}
\item During most of the last century important papers or inventions were mostly developed by a single author 
\item Since 2000s top cited papers or inventions are developed by a team.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\pause

\begin{block}{\textbf{Socialization} concept drawn from the Marxian tradition \citep{adler:2007}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Political Science: transfer of ownership from the private to the public sphere.
\item In Psychology: process whereby people new to a culture internalize its knowledge, norms and values.
\item Marx's use was broader than either and encompasses both:
\end{itemize}
\begin{quote}
The [...] socialized (i.e. collective) labour come into being through cooperation, division of labour within the workshop, the use of machinery, and in general, the transformation of production by the conscious use of the sciences, of mechanics, chemistry, etc. for specific ends, technology, etc. and similarly, through the enormous increase of scale corresponding to such developments (for it is only socialized labour that is capable of applying the general products of human development, such as mathematics, to the immediate process of production; [...]). \citep[1024]{marx:1990}
\end{quote}
\end{block}

\end{frame}
\note{\citet*{uzzi:2007a} show that until 1950s the likelihood that an important ---ie wildly cited--- paper or invention was developed by a single author was bigger than it was developed by a team. But this trend has experimented a shift in the last four decades. The rising importance of collective research and cooperation is illustrated by the fact that top cited papers are mostly created by teams in 2000s.}

Focus on Cooperation networks: patterns of relations that direct producers establish in the production process.
\begin{itemize}

\item Structural approach, that is, a network approach.

\begin{itemize}

\item Sub-groups that are more connected internally than with the rest of the network. 
\item Longitudinal analysis of the formation and dissolution of these groups.
\item Key mechanisms to explain and understand large scale cooperation.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Man Topic and Research Question}
\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Main Topic and Research Question}

The central topic of this thesis is to understand and explain under which conditions and through which social mechanisms large scale cooperation operates. 

\begin{block}{Free and Open Source Software as a case study}
\begin{description}
\item[Free Software] is computer software that allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve it.  
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item Availability of detailed data about the production process.
\item Impressive increment of scale in the last two decades.
\item Allows to analyze the development methods of FOSS from the perspective of a knowledge based production process.
\item focusing on the patterns of relations between direct producers we can analyze key mechanisms that enable and foster large scale cooperation.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Research question}
How does large scale cooperation work in knowledge intensive and technically complex production processes developed in new organizational environments, such as Free and Open Source Software projects, where loosely coupled individuals that rarely meet face to face have to coordinate through internet in order to produce world class software products, without relying on hierarchy or market as coordinating mechanisms.
\end{block}
\end{frame}


\section{Cohesive Groups: The Structural Cohesion Model}


\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Group Cohesion in the sociological literature}

Central concept that has a long and illustrious history in sociology. Its use in most sociological research has been ambiguous at best \citep{moody:2003}: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item sloppy definitions of cohesion with lack of generality.

\item grounded mostly in intuition and common sense.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{block}{Group cohesion \citep{doreian:1998} can be divided analytically into:}

\begin{description}

\item[Ideational component] based on the members' identification with a collectivity.

\item[Relational component] based on the patterns of connections among members.

\end{description}

\end{block}

\pause

The relational component of group cohesion has been the focus of Social Network Analysis.

\begin{block}{Network theory measures used to define group cohesion}

\begin{description}

\item[Classical measures] cliques, clans, clubs, $k$-cores, lambda sets, ...

\item[Community algorithms] detect groups of nodes more densely connected among them than with the rest of the network.

\end{description}

\end{block}

Neither the classical approaches nor new developments in community analysis work well in empirical analysis of group cohesion.

\end{frame}

\end{columns}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Structural cohesion model}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The structural cohesion model}

The structural cohesion model \citep{white:2001,moody:2003} is based on two mathematically equivalent definitions of cohesion.

\begin{block}{Precise definition of group cohesion based on \textbf{node connectivity}}

\begin{itemize}

\item a group's structural cohesion is equal to the minimum number of actors who, if removed from the group, would disconnect the group.

\item a group's structural cohesion is equal to the minimum number of node independent paths linking each pair of actors in the group.

\end{itemize}
\end{block}

This equivalence relation has a deep sociological meaning because it allows to define structural cohesion in terms of:

\begin{itemize}

\item the difficulty to pull a group apart by removing actors.

\item multiple relations between actors that keep a group together.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Measures of structural cohesion}

\begin{block}{Node connectivity $\kappa(G)$}
\begin{description}
\item[Local] given two nodes $u$ and $v$, $\kappa_{G}(u,v)$ is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to destroy all paths that join $u$ and $v$.

\item[Global] the minimum number of nodes that must be removed in order to disconnect a graph $G$.

\begin{equation*}
\kappa = min{\{\kappa_{G}(u,v):u,v \in V(G)\}}
\end{equation*}

\end{description}

\end{block}

\begin{block}{Average node connectivity $\bar{\kappa}(G)$}
the sum of local node connectivity between all pairs of different nodes of $G$ divided by the number of distinct pairs of nodes. \citep*{beineke:2002}.

\begin{equation*}
\bar{\kappa}(G) = \frac{\sum_{u,v} \kappa_{G}(u,v)}{{n \choose 2}}
\end{equation*}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{$k$-components}
A $k$-component is a maximal subgraph that has, at least, node connectivity $k$: we need to remove at least $k$ nodes to break it into more components. 
\end{block}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{img/knum_colors}
\end{center}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Structural cohesion in empirical analysis}

Structural cohesion is a powerful and robust explanatory factor for a wide variety of interesting empirical social phenomena: 

\begin{itemize}

\item likelihood of building alliances and partnerships among biotech firms \citep{powell:2005}

\item school attachment and academic performance of young people and the tendency of firms to enroll in similar political activity behaviors \citep{moody:2003}

\item emerging trust relations among neighborhood residents and the hiring relations among top level US graduate programs \citep{grannis:2009}

\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Some problems with the structural cohesion model}

Despite all its merits, the structural cohesion model has not been widely applied to empirical analysis because:

\begin{itemize}

\item it is not practical to compute it for networks with more than a few hundreds nodes and edges due to its computational complexity.

\item it is not implemented in most popular network analysis software packages.

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Algorithms and Heuristics}

\subsubsection{Exact algorithm for structural cohesion}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Exact Algorithm}

\citet[appendix A]{moody:2003} provide an algorithm for identifying $k$-components in a network, which is based on the \citet{kanevsky:1993} algorithm for finding all minimum-size node cut-sets of a graph.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Identify the node connectivity, $k$, of the input graph.

\item Identify all $k$-cutsets at the current level of connectivity.

\item Generate new graph components based on the removal of these cutsets.

\item If the graph is neither complete nor trivial, return to 1; otherwise end.

\end{enumerate}


\begin{columns}[c]

\subsubsection{Heuristics for computing structural cohesion}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Heuristics}

The heuristics we developed are based on:

\begin{block}{Approximation to local node connectivity}
\citet{white:2001b} fast approximation algorithm for finding good lower bounds of the number of node independent paths between two nodes.

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{0.1\textwidth}

\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.8\textwidth}
\begin{scriptsize}
\begin{lstlisting}
import networkx as nx
from networkx.algorithms import approximation as apxa
# Exact computation of node connectivity
exact = nx.node_connectivity(G)
# Lower bound approximation
aprox = apxa.node_connectivity(G)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.1\textwidth}

\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Whitney's theorem}
inclusion relation among node connectivity $\kappa(G)$, edge connectivity $\lambda(G)$ and minimum degree $\delta(G)$ for any graph $G$:

\begin{equation*}
\kappa(G) \le \lambda(G) \le \delta(G)
\end{equation*}

``$k$-cores can be regarded as seedbeds, within which we can expect highly cohesive subsets to be found'' \citet[281]{seidman:1983}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Heuristics}

\begin{block}{Main logic of the heuristics}

\begin{enumerate}

\item repeatedly applying fast algorithms for $k$-cores \citep{batagelj:2011} and biconnected components \citep{tarjan:1972} in order to narrow down the number of pairs of different nodes over which we have to compute their local node connectivity.

\item Build an auxiliary graph $H$ in which two nodes are linked if they have at least $k$ node independent paths connecting them.

\item Complete subgraphs in $H$ have a one to one correspondence with subgraphs of $G$ in which each node is connected to every other node in the subgraph for at least $k$ node independent paths. That is, $k$-components.

\section{The Network Structure of Collaborative Communities}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Collaborative Communities}
A new form of community, qualitatively different from the traditional \emph{Gemeinschaft} and the modern \emph{Gesellschaft} \citep{tonnies:1974}. 

\begin{block}{Collaborative Communities \citep{adler:2006}}
Novel organizational form ---both inside and outside large capitalist corporations--- strongly grounded on large scale cooperation which defy the traditional dichotomy between \textbf{hierarchy} and \textbf{market} as coordinating mechanisms.

\begin{itemize}
\item Generalized trust based on other's contributions towards a shared end.
\item Conscious cooperation and high individual interdependence.
\item Shared values and value-rational basis for legitimate authority. 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

So far scarce attention is given to the structural features of collaborative communities.

\begin{description}
\item[Question] explore the network structure that lead to their emergence and effectiveness in the production and diffusion of knowledge.

\item[Contribution] I suggest that a unique network structure undergirds collaborative communities and build a model to understand its key mechanisms: the \textbf{cohesive small world} model.
\end{description}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{knowledge-based production processes}
Collaborative Communities are especially well suited to deal with the challenges of knowledge-based production processes because, hierarchy and market have proved ineffective, at best, at managing knowledge.  

\begin{columns}[c]

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Hierarchy as a coordinating mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge is treated as a scare resource.
\item Centralized at the higher levels where key decisions are taken.
\item Rigidity prevents flexibility to deal with unanticipated problems.
\item Difficulty to foster innovation and generation of new knowledge.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Market as coordinating mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fails to optimize at the same time production and allocation of knowledge.
\item Knowledge is a public good that grow rather than diminish with use.
\item Strong property rights incentive knowledge production, but
\item they block socially optimal allocation (free access).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\end{columns}

\begin{block}{Collaborative Communities that excel at knowledge-based production}
\begin{itemize}
\item Free and Open Source Communities.
\item Novel forms of professional work organization \citep*{adler:2008}.
\item Knowledge-intensive production processes in corporations \citep{adler:2006}.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{A network model for Collaborative Communities}

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{The Small World Model}
Networks characterized by a high level of local density of social ties and short average distances among nodes.

\begin{itemize}
\item $L$: average number of intermediaries between any two nodes.
\item $CC$: mean probability that two nodes that are neighbors of the same other node will themselves be neighbors.
\item They foster the flow of information and ideas.

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{The Structural Cohesion Model}
Networks characterized by the presence of increasingly cohesive groups nested inside each other. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Cohesion definition based on the graph-theoretic property of connectivity.
\item $k$-components as the key subgroups of the network.
\item They foster the development of trust and social cohesion.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\end{columns}

These two models are not mutually exclusive. The networks that fit in the intersection of both models exhibit consistent structural patterns.

\begin{block}{Cohesive Small World Model}
Network (structural) model for Collaborative Communities that help explain how trust, value congruence, and large scale cooperation are enabled and fostered.

\begin{itemize}
\item Local clusters connected by short paths.
\item Increasingly cohesive groups nested inside each other.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

These patterns provide the structural scaffolding for collaborative communities.

\note{On the one hand, the generation of trust and congruent values among heterogeneous individuals are fostered by structurally cohesive groups in the connectivity hierarchy of cooperation networks because individuals embedded in these structures are able to compare independent perspectives on each other through a variety of relations that flow through distinct sets of intermediaries, which provides multiple independent sources of information about each other. Thus, the perception of an individual embedded in such structures of the other members of the group to whom she is not directly linked is filtered by the perception of a variety of others whom she trusts because is directly linked to them. This mediated perception of the group generates trust at a global scale. On the other hand, the existence of dense local clusters connected between them by relative short paths allows successful cooperation among heterogeneous individuals with common interests and, at the same time, fosters the flow of information between these clusters preventing the local clusters to be trapped in echo chambers of like minded collaborators.}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cooperation Networks and Null Models}

My modeling strategy to capture the patterns of relations among developers in these two projects is to focus on the actual contributions of each developer to the project. 

\begin{block}{Building Cooperation Networks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on the patterns of relations among developers in the productive process.
\item Cooperation networks are bipartite or two mode; node sets are developers and programs/files and edges only link nodes from opposite sets.
\item A developer is linked to the package (in Debian) or source code file (in Python) that she works on.
\item We have complete electronic records of all package uplads to Debain and all sorce code file edits in Python.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Building Suitable Null models}
\begin{itemize}
\item We need to compare the statistical measures obtained from the actual networks with a suitable null model in order to assert that what we observe is not the result of pure chance.
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item [Configuration Model] assigns at random developers to packages, or developers to source code files, maintaining the concrete skewed distribution of packages by developer and files by developer observed in the actual networks. That is, the degree distribution.

\caption[Survival function using the Kaplan-Meier estimate.]{Estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier estimate. The median survival time of a developer in the community, defined as the point in time where on average half of the population has abandoned the community, is 6 years if I consider all developers (left). But if I consider separately the developers in the top level of the connectivity hierarchy (right), their median survival time is 12 years; but only 3 years for the developers that are not on the top of the connectivity hierarchy.}
