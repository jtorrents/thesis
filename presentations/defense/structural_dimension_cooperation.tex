\section{Large Scale Cooperation}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Central Topic: Large Scale Cooperation}

The last half of twentieth century has witnessed a key shift in knowledge intensive production processes.

\begin{block}{The rising importance of collective research and cooperation \citep{uzzi:2007a}}
\begin{itemize}
\item During most of the last century important papers or inventions were mostly developed by a single author 
\item Since 2000s top cited papers or inventions are developed by a team.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\pause

\begin{block}{\textbf{Socialization} concept drawn from the Marxian tradition \citep{adler:2007}}
\begin{itemize}
\item In Political Science: transfer of ownership from the private to the public sphere.
\item In Psychology: process whereby people new to a culture internalize its knowledge, norms and values.
\item Marx's use was broader than either and encompasses both:
\end{itemize}
\begin{quote}
The [...] socialized (i.e. collective) labour come into being through cooperation, division of labour within the workshop, the use of machinery, and in general, the transformation of production by the conscious use of the sciences, of mechanics, chemistry, etc. for specific ends, technology, etc. and similarly, through the enormous increase of scale corresponding to such developments (for it is only socialized labour that is capable of applying the general products of human development, such as mathematics, to the immediate process of production; [...]). \citep[1024]{marx:1990}
\end{quote}
\end{block}

\end{frame}
\note{\citet*{uzzi:2007a} show that until 1950s the likelihood that an important ---ie wildly cited--- paper or invention was developed by a single author was bigger than it was developed by a team. But this trend has experimented a shift in the last four decades. The rising importance of collective research and cooperation is illustrated by the fact that top cited papers are mostly created by teams in 2000s.}



\subsection{Theoretical Approaches to Cooperation}
\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Theoretical Approaches to Cooperation}

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{block}{Macro level approach}
Cooperation as a macro level phenomenon in which the center of analysis is the collective or group \citep{marx:1990, adler:2006, adler:2015}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Focus on large organizations and groups: Collaborative Communities

\begin{itemize}

\item Shared values and goals
\item Generalized trust
\item Authority forms

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\pause

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{block}{Micro level approach}
Cooperation as a micro level phenomenon in which the center of analysis is the dyad \citep{axelrod1981, watts:1999, eguiluz:2005}.

\begin{itemize}

\item Reductionist approach: Cooperation as an atomic process.

\begin{itemize}

\item Strategic dyadic interactions.
\item Agent-based models.
\item Payoffs of different strategies.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{block}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\pause

\begin{block}{A Meso level approach to Cooperation}
Focus on Cooperation networks: patterns of relations that direct producers establish in the production process.
\begin{itemize}

\item Structural approach, that is, a network approach.

\begin{itemize}

\item Sub-groups that are more connected internally than with the rest of the network. 
\item Longitudinal analysis of the formation and dissolution of these groups.
\item Key mechanisms to explain and understand large scale cooperation.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\subsection{Main Topic and Research Question}
\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Main Topic and Research Question}

The central topic of this thesis is to understand and explain under which conditions and through which social mechanisms large scale cooperation operates. 

\begin{block}{Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) as a case study}
\begin{description}
\item[Free Software] is computer software that allows users to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve it.  
\end{description}
\begin{itemize}
\item Availability of detailed data about the production process.
\item Impressive increment of scale in the last two decades.
\item Allows to analyze the development methods of FOSS from the perspective of a knowledge based production process.
\item focusing on the patterns of relations between direct producers we can analyze key mechanisms that enable and foster large scale cooperation.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\pause

\begin{block}{Research question}
How does large scale cooperation work in knowledge intensive and technically complex production processes developed in new organizational environments, such as Free and Open Source Software projects, where loosely coupled individuals that rarely meet face to face have to coordinate through internet in order to produce world class software products, without relying on hierarchy or market as coordinating mechanisms.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Literature on FOSS}

\begin{block}{The literature has focused on 4 main areas:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item individual incentives.
\item innovation and intellectual property policy.
\item development methods (mainly from Computer Science).
\item organization and governance.
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\pause

\begin{block}{This research focuses on the intersection of areas 3 and 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item analyze how individuals coordinate their actions in order to achieve collective outcomes.
\item focus on the patterns of relations of direct producers to analyze meso level mechanisms that enable and foster large scale cooperation.
\item FOSS projects as a case study; a proxy to analyze large scale cooperation in the context of new organizational forms.
\item FOSS tenets are closely related to the ethos of science as described by \citet{merton:1942}, and thus analyzing FOSS we can generalize to other large scale cooperation social processes.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\section{Cohesive Groups: The Structural Cohesion Model}


\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Group Cohesion in the sociological literature}

Central concept that has a long and illustrious history in sociology. Its use in most sociological research has been ambiguous at best \citep{moody:2003}: 

\begin{enumerate}

\item sloppy definitions of cohesion with lack of generality.

\item grounded mostly in intuition and common sense.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{block}{Group cohesion \citep{doreian:1998} can be divided analytically into:}

\begin{description}

\item[Ideational component] based on the members' identification with a collectivity.

\item[Relational component] based on the patterns of connections among members.

\end{description}

\end{block}

\pause

The relational component of group cohesion has been the focus of Social Network Analysis.

\begin{block}{Network theory measures used to define group cohesion}

\begin{description}

\item[Classical measures] cliques, clans, clubs, $k$-cores, lambda sets, ...

\item[Community algorithms] detect groups of nodes more densely connected among them than with the rest of the network.

\end{description}

\end{block}

Neither the classical approaches nor new developments in community analysis work well in empirical analysis of group cohesion.

\end{frame}


\subsection{Key properties of cohesion measures}

\begin{frame}[label=]
\frametitle{Key properties that a cohesion measures should have}

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{0.3\textwidth}

\end{center}
\end{column}

\end{columns}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Structural cohesion model}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The structural cohesion model}

The structural cohesion model \citep{white:2001,moody:2003} is based on two mathematically equivalent definitions of cohesion (by Menger's theorem).

\begin{block}{Precise definition of group cohesion based on \textbf{node connectivity}}

\begin{itemize}

\item a group's structural cohesion is equal to the minimum number of actors who, if removed from the group, would disconnect the group.

\item a group's structural cohesion is equal to the minimum number of node independent paths linking each pair of actors in the group.

\end{itemize}
\end{block}

This equivalence relation has a deep sociological meaning because it allows to define structural cohesion in terms of:

\begin{itemize}

\item the difficulty to pull a group apart by removing actors.

\item multiple relations between actors that keep a group together.

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Components, node connectivity, and $k$-components}

\begin{block}{Component}
A \emph{component} of a graph $G$ is a maximal connected subgraph, which means that there is at least one path between any two nodes in that subgraph.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Node connectivity $\kappa(G)$}
The minimum number of nodes that must be removed in order to disconnect a graph $G$.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{$k$-components}
A $k$-component is a maximal subgraph that has, at least, node connectivity $k$: we need to remove at least $k$ nodes to break it into more components. 
\end{block}

\pause

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{img/knum_colors}
\end{center}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Red Nodes} form a 4-component: we need to remove 4 nodes to disconnect it.
\item \textbf{Purple Nodes} form a 3-component along with red nodes: we need to remove 3 nodes to disconnect it.
\item \textbf{Blue Nodes} form a 2-component along with red and purple nodes: we need to remove 2 nodes to disconnect it. 
\end{itemize}
\end{column}
\end{columns}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Structural cohesion in empirical analysis}

Structural cohesion is a powerful and robust explanatory factor for a wide variety of interesting empirical social phenomena: 

\begin{itemize}

\item likelihood of building alliances and partnerships among biotech firms \citep{powell:2005}

\item school attachment and academic performance of young people and the tendency of firms to enroll in similar political activity behaviors \citep{moody:2003}

\item emerging trust relations among neighborhood residents and the hiring relations among top level US graduate programs \citep{grannis:2009}

\end{itemize}

\pause

\begin{block}{Some problems with the structural cohesion model}

Despite all its merits, the structural cohesion model has not been widely applied to empirical analysis because:

\begin{itemize}

\item it is not practical to compute it for networks with more than a few hundreds nodes and edges due to its computational complexity.

\item it was not implemented in most popular network analysis software packages.

\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{columns}[c]
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Implementation of connectivity measures}
All contributed to NetworkX \citep{hagberg:2008}.
\begin{itemize}
\item Node and edge connectivity algorithms.
\item \citet{kanevsky:1993} algorithm for finding all minimum-size node cut-sets of a graph.
\item \citet{moody:2003} algorithm for identifying $k$-components.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Developed heuristics for fast computation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow computing the approximate value of group cohesion for moderately large networks, one order of magnitude bigger than the ones manageable by the exact algorithm. 
\item The main logic of the heuristics is to repeatedly applying fast algorithms for $k$-cores and biconnected components in order to narrow down the number of pairs of nodes over which we have to compute node connectivity.

\section{The Network Structure of Collaborative Communities}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Collaborative Communities}
A new form of community, qualitatively different from the traditional \emph{Gemeinschaft} and the modern \emph{Gesellschaft} \citep{tonnies:1974}. 

\begin{block}{Collaborative Communities \citep{adler:2006}}
Novel organizational form ---both inside and outside large capitalist corporations--- strongly grounded on large scale cooperation which defy the traditional dichotomy between \textbf{hierarchy} and \textbf{market} as coordinating mechanisms.

\begin{itemize}
\item Generalized trust based on other's contributions towards a shared end.
\item Conscious cooperation and high individual interdependence.
\item Shared values and value-rational basis for legitimate authority. 
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\pause

So far scarce attention is given to the structural features of collaborative communities.

\begin{description}
\item[Question] explore the network structure that lead to their emergence and effectiveness in the production and diffusion of knowledge.

\item[Contribution] I suggest that a unique network structure undergirds collaborative communities and build a model to understand its key mechanisms: the \textbf{cohesive small world} model.
\end{description}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{knowledge-based production processes}
Collaborative Communities are especially well suited to deal with the challenges of knowledge-based production processes because, hierarchy and market have proved ineffective, at best, at managing knowledge.  

\begin{columns}[c]

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Hierarchy as a coordinating mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge is treated as a scare resource.
\item Centralized at the higher levels where key decisions are taken.
\item Rigidity prevents flexibility to deal with unanticipated problems.
\item Difficulty to foster innovation and generation of new knowledge.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{column}

\pause

\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
\begin{block}{Market as coordinating mechanism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fails to optimize at the same time production and allocation of knowledge.
\item Knowledge is a public good that grow rather than diminish with use.
\item Strong property rights incentive knowledge production, but
\item they block socially optimal allocation (free access).
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Collaborative Communities that excel at knowledge-based production}
\begin{itemize}
\item Free and Open Source Software communities.
\item Novel forms of professional work organization \citep*{adler:2008}
\item Knowledge-intensive production processes in corporations \citep{adler:2006}
%\item contribution-based trust as its primary social mechanism: ``The basis of trust is the degree to which members of the community believe that others have contributions to make towards this shared [end]'' \citep[21]{adler:2006}.

\begin{block}{Social Structure as key element}

\note{On the one hand, the generation of trust and congruent values among heterogeneous individuals are fostered by structurally cohesive groups in the connectivity hierarchy of cooperation networks because individuals embedded in these structures are able to compare independent perspectives on each other through a variety of relations that flow through distinct sets of intermediaries, which provides multiple independent sources of information about each other. Thus, the perception of an individual embedded in such structures of the other members of the group to whom she is not directly linked is filtered by the perception of a variety of others whom she trusts because is directly linked to them. This mediated perception of the group generates trust at a global scale. On the other hand, the existence of dense local clusters connected between them by relative short paths allows successful cooperation among heterogeneous individuals with common interests and, at the same time, fosters the flow of information between these clusters preventing the local clusters to be trapped in echo chambers of like minded collaborators.}

The analysis of the hierarchical structure of organizations has been a central topic on organizational research in the last decades.

Focus the analysis on the ratio of renewal of the individuals in the positions defined by that hierarchy.

\vspace{0.5cm}

I propose that hierarchical structures can be classified in a continuum, the two extreme points of which are: 

\begin{description}
\item[Static Hierarchy] where when an individual is appointed in a position of the hierarchy, this position is for life.
\item[Dynamic Hierarchy] where the individuals occupying positions defined by the hierarchy have a very high pace of renewal.
\end{description}

Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities have attracted a lot of attention from researchers. Academic efforts took mainly two directions:

\item Only few of the participants account for the lion's share of the work done.
%\item The deep contribution inequalities may mean that these projects follow the ``iron law of the oligarchy'' \citep{shaw:2014}.
%\item I propose that one of the central characteristics of FOSS projects is their high ratio of turnover in key hierarchical positions.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}

\begin{block}{Puzzle: FOSS projects as Oligarchies?}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

\pause

\vspace{0.1cm}

\begin{block}{Longitudinal Analysis of the Social Structure of FOSS projects}
If we analyze a FOSS project in a concrete point of time, only a very small fraction of the participants are the ones that actually do the lion's share of contributions, as previous empirical research has shown.

However if we analyze the evolution of contributions longitudinally, we find that the persons that contribute the most change through time.
\end{block}

\pause

%\vspace{0.1cm}

\begin{block}{Main Empirical Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item The developers that contribute the most are in the higher levels of the connectivity structure of the project's cooperation networks.

\item The ratio of renewal of individuals at these structural positions is quite fast, which characterizes FOSS communities as dynamic hierarchies and open elites.

\item The position of an individual in the connectivity structure of the cooperation network also shapes the median active life of a developer in the project.
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\note{Thus, if we analyze cross-sectionally (ie in a concrete point of time) a FOSS project, a very small fraction of the participants are the ones that actually do the lion's share of contributions, as previous empirical research has shown. However if we analyze the evolution of contributions longitudinally, we find that the persons that contribute the most change through time.}

\note{From the figures on the previous slide, it is clear that there is a strong correlation between the connectivity level of a developer and her level of contribution to the project.

The hierarchical structure of the cooperation network shapes the volume of contribution of individual developers.}

To further the analysis I used more sophisticated statistical modeling strategies to assess the impact of the connectivity structure in the individual contributions to the project.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Debian package uploads:} Modeled with a negative binomial regression. Over-dispersed and discrete dependent variable: \# of uploads. The $k$-component number is the second most important independent variable only after Degree Centrality.

\item \textbf{Added source code lines to Python:} Modeled with a panel regression with individual and year fixed effect. Dependent variable treated as a continuous variable. The $k$-component number is also the second most important independent variable only after Degree Centrality.

\end{itemize}

\pause

\begin{block}{Potential endogenity problems of the previous models}
There is a relation between the dependent variable and the network metrics (independent variables) because the cooperation networks are build precisely based on contributions to the projects.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Number of accepted \textit{Python Enhancement Proposals} (PEP):} Modeled with a zero inflated negative binomial. PEPs are design documents that define the language; are thus contributions not directly related to the cooperation networks. Being part of the top connectivity level is also the second most important independent variable, this time only after developer's tenure (in years).

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Cooperation Networks' Connectivity Hierarchies as Open Elites}

The ratio of renewal of individuals at the top of the connectivity hierarchy is quite fast, which characterizes the CPython project as an open elite.

\section{Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Cooperation Networks:} A meso level approach to large scale cooperation focused on the patterns of relations that direct producers establish between them in knowledge intensive production processes.

\item \textbf{The Cohesive Small World model}: The structural patterns defined by this model provide the scaffolding for enabling effective large scale cooperation.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Structurally cohesive groups nested inside each other} that form a connectivity hierarchy. Provide a plausible mechanism of generation of trust and congruent values: individuals embedded in these structures are able to compare independent perspectives on each other through a variety of paths that flow through distinct sets of intermediaries.

\item \textbf{Dense local clusters connected by short paths} is a structural pattern that fosters information flow allowing successful cooperation among heterogeneous individuals with common interests. 
\end{itemize}

\item I \textbf{developed heuristics} to compute the $k$-components structure that allow for the computing of the approximate value of group cohesion for moderately large networks in a reasonable time frame.

\item I \textbf{contributed an implementation} of these heuristics, and other related connectivity measures, to a popular Python software package for the analysis of complex networks: NetworkX \citep{hagberg:2008}.

\end{itemize}

\note{
\begin{itemize}
\item The generation of trust and congruent values among heterogeneous individuals are fostered by structurally cohesive groups in the connectivity hierarchy of cooperation networks because individuals embedded in these structures are able to compare independent perspectives on each other through a variety of paths that flow through distinct sets of intermediaries, which provides multiple independent sources of information about each other. This mediated perception of the group generates trust at a global scale.

\item The existence of dense local clusters connected between them by relative short paths allows successful cooperation among heterogeneous individuals with common interests and, at the same time, fosters the flow of information between these clusters preventing the local clusters to be trapped in echo chambers of like minded collaborators.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item The \textbf{Cohesive Small World} model is a good fit to describe the cooperation networks of two big and mature FOSS projects: the Python programming language, and the Debian operating system.

\item This model captures the \textbf{hierarchy in the patterns of relations} that individual contributors establish when working together.

\begin{itemize}
\item reflects the empirically well established fact that in FOSS projects only a small fraction of the developers account for most of the contributions.

\item refutes the naive views of early academic accounts that characterized FOSS projects as a flat hierarchy of peers in which every individual does more or less the same.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Cooperation has a structural dimension} because membership in cohesive groups has an important and statistically significative impact on both the volume of individual contributions, and on the median active life of developers.

\item The connectivity structure of these collaborative communities' cooperation networks can be characterized as an \textbf{open elite}, where the top levels of this hierarchy are filled with new individuals at a high pace. 

\item This is a \textbf{key mechanism} that allows FOSS communities to develop long term projects, with high individual turnover, and yet achieve high impact and coherent results as a result of large scale cooperation.

\item \textbf{Socialization}, in Marxian terms, is a necessary condition for the \textbf{open elite dynamic}: replacing tacit knowledge generated in local contexts by knowledge that is explicitly codified and disseminated at a global level is what allows new individuals to join the top levels of the connectivity hierarchy at a high pace.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Limitations and Future Work}

\begin{itemize}

\item It's not clear that the theoretical model that I proposed fits all cooperation networks of Collaborative Communities, in general, or even cooperation networks of FOSS projects, in particular.

\item The empirical analysis presented in this thesis was aimed to develop a theoretical framework.

\item The case study of two successful projects is therefore an existence proof, not an empirical test of the Cohesive Small World Model.

\item The next steps in my research agenda will be to expand the kind of empirical analysis that I presented in this thesis to include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Both successful and unsuccessful large scale cooperation projects. There is abundant data on failed FOSS projects.

\item Other knowledge intensive production processes beyond FOSS projects:

\begin{itemize}
\item Scientific collaborations and coauthorship
\item State sponsored large scale scientific and technical projects (such as Space exploration)
\item Productions processes inside big capitalist corporations  
\end{itemize}

A network fits the small world model if it is more locally clustered ($CC$) than its random network counterpart but has approximately the same average distance ($L$) between nodes.

Q = \frac{CC_{ratio}}{L_{ratio}} \nonumber & \hspace{0.5cm} \textit{Where:} & 
CC_{ratio}& = \frac{CC_{actual}}{CC_{random}} \nonumber &
L_{ratio}& = \frac{L_{actual}}{L_{random}} \nonumber \\

%\subsection*{Appendix: Computing Structural Cohesion Metrics}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Structural Cohesion Analysis}

Analyze the percentage of nodes in $k$-components in actual networks and in their random counterparts.

For $k \leq 2$ the random null model is the upper bound of component size. Thus a network fits the model if it has more levels ($k$) than its random counterparts and the percentage of nodes for $k \leq 2$ is comparable.

\item For 1-components $|V_{actual}| < |V_{random}|$
\item For 2-components $|V_{actual}| < |V_{random}|$
\item Maximum $k$:\\ $3 \leq max(k_{actual}) \leq 5$ and\\ $2 \leq  max(k_{random}) \leq 3$, but always \\ $max(k_{actual}) > max(k_{random})$.

\begin{itemize}
\item For 1-components $|V_{actual}| \approx |V_{random}|$
\item For 2-components $|V_{actual}| \approx |V_{random}|$
\item Maximum $k$:\\ $5 \leq max(k_{actual}) \leq 10$ and\\ $3 \leq  max(k_{random}) \leq 7$, but always\\ $max(k_{actual}) > max(k_{random})$.

The fact that cooperation networks in the Python project are more cohesive than the cooperation networks of the Debian project, can also be attributed in part to the lower modularity of Python as a programming language compared with the inherent modularity of the Debian project as an operating system.
