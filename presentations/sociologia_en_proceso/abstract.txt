The Structural Dimesion of Cooperation

Most important discoveries and innovations in science and technology are not anymore the result of the work of individuals working alone but the result of cooperation. The aim of this research is to bridge the gap between macro and micro level theoretical approaches to cooperation by focusing on the structural dimension of cooperation, that is, the patterns of relations between the individuals that participate in production processes. This meso level approach to cooperation shows that between the dyadic interactions among individuals, and the shared goals and visions that guide large organizations and groups, the dynamic formation of subgroups of individuals in cooperation networks is a key mechanism for fostering the increase of scale of cooperation that we have witnessed during the last decades.
